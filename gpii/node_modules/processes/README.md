GPII Node.js Processes Bridge
-----------------------------

The GPII prcoesses bridge is a Node.js bridge to GNOME/Linux's native libraries
to acquire information about running processes, written in C++.

To compile the module:

* Run build.sh at the top of this repository (TBD -- use Gruntfile.js?).

Or, by hand:

* cd nodeprocesses
* node-gyp configure build
* node nodeprocesses_tests.js # Run the tests


Notes
-----

var procArray = nodeprocess.getProcesses();


var commandName = "orca";
var orcaProc = fluid.find (procArray, function (procInfo) {
                  if (procInfo.command === commandName) {
                    return procInfo;
                  }
                }, null);

A proccess is represented by the following structure (using orca as an example):

{
  pid: 3911,
  uid: 1000,
  gid: 1000,
  command: 'orca',
  fullPath: '/usr/bin/python3',
  argv: [ '/usr/bin/python3', '/usr/bin/orca' ],
  state: 'Sleeping'
}

The state member can be one of:
* Running
* Stopped
* Zombie
* Uninterruptible
* Sleeping
